			<h1>Makoto Sprite Edits + Prototype Progress (25/02/2023)</h1>
			<p>Connor here, I think I'm going to make a commitment here and now, every day I will update this website with something new, whether it be something I create, an opinion, educational piece or experience I wish to share, I will post it here. Thank you to every one of my friends reading this right now, it means a lot to me that you care enough to read something I write, even if it's just a simple blog post.</p>
			<p>Anyway, I have been working on multiple things and playing multiple games today which I believe those reading will find interesting to read about. First off, my friend recently made an avatar to represent himself if he were to livestream (unfortunately he cannot due to his underpowered hardware, which I hope can be corrected in the future!), since I would be interested in going on these streams if they are to happen in the future, I made these sprite edits of Makoto Yuki, better known as the Persona 3 Protagonist, as an avatar for his streams, you can find them below:</p>

			<p>The left one just moves his eyes so that they are facing to look at whatever would be being streamed rather than just looking straight into the forth wall, and the right one is of Makoto talking, which would pop up if I talk on stream. If you can't tell the stream avatar goes for the pngtuber look that streamers like Phisnom go for with his and his co-host's avatars (which I took a lot of inspiration from, mainly caco's avatar).</p>
			<p>Speaking of Persona 3, I got back to playing the recent 'remaster' of Persona 3 Portable on PC, even if it is a lackluster remaster with awful mouse controls and badly AI upscaled backgrounds, the game is so good that it doesn't even bother me that much. You might notice that I didn't mention anything about the audio being compressed and that's because it sounds perfectly fine on my hardware, note that my PC is really old and bad so maybe it's sound card is outdated enough for it to not compress the audio??? I'm not quite sure but I'm glad it's not an issue I have cause the compressed audio sounds AWFUL.</p>
			<p>I have also started playing MGS4, a game I've owned for months but haven't got around to playing and boy was that a mistake, the game is really fun despite my lack of skill in tactical espionage action. Still waiting for when Raiden shows up cause he was already really cool in MGR:R. One thing I also discovered today is that the entire mainline MGS franchise is on the PS3! You can play MGS1 through the psOne Classic service on the Playstation Store, MGS2 and 3 in the HD Collection, MGS4 (duh) and even MGS5 (even if it is downgraded graphically). That isn't to mention the fact that you can also play MGR:R and MGS:PW. Truly the ultimate MGS machine.</p>
			<p>I also went back to playing danmaku games such as Touhou 6 Embodiment of Scarlet Devil and Exceed 2nd Vampire Rex, not much to say except WOW, I suck at them way more than I remember so I gotta get back to playing more danmaku games.</p>
			<p>Finally, I would like to talk about progress on a prototype I'm working on for a game. It is a sandbox game, based on yesterday's poll, I am not going to reveal much about it cause it is still early in pre-production and implementation but I have created some basic UI code for it, that being that whenever you start a new scene or restart the game or whatever the background colour is randomized. Simple, but pretty cool, not to mention how much backend pygame stuff I've done not involving UI. I hope to post more ../images and videos of the development process in the upcoming blog posts.</p>
