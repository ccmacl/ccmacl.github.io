			<p>Introducing, "ccmacl's pygame sandbox"! Yeah original name I know, I may change it out for something later but I am quite attached to the name so I don't think I will, at least for now. Based on my poll on the Website Release post, I have decided to make a sandbox game where you command these "squares" to move around player-made environments to eliminate the enemy "squares". I have loads of ideas to implement such as weapons, explosions, AI pathfinding, an ally system, camera controls, the ability to build structures, different floors in structures, save/load system, all the sort. As you can see, this is a very early version without any of these features, but I hope that the concept will get you on board with checking out the site for development updates. I personally cannot wait to get this complete and released so anyone can create their own battles, but I want to make sure I release it in the most polished and playable state possible, though I will publish some prerelease versions and teasers while I work on the full game.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in the concept and want to pitch any ideas or have any questions, please fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/TkZYufDHDacASq1TA"><b>THIS</b></a> form and your questions will be answered and or pitches be reviewed in the next post! Thanks for reading once again, and I wish you the best day possible. Goodbye!</p>
