			<p style="margin:8px">On the 9th of June in 2021, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qSvILi_2Io" target="_blank">Monika Full Week</a> mod was released for Friday Night Funkin, as the title suggests, it was a single week mod with 3 songs. The mod would soon recieve another update titled <a href="https://youtu.be/0H6ykqItvh8" target="_blank">Monika Full Week Rebooted</a>, featuring a revamped 2nd song and gimmick notes, this all being before the massive update called <a href="https://youtu.be/2aKpl9o7CsU" target="_blank">Doki Doki Takeover</a> featuring 5 new weeks and tons of bonus material, not to mention a 'What if?'-type spinoff mod was also created called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toVb1Q1Ol7I" target="_blank">Doki Doki Takeover Bad Ending</a>.</p>
			<p style="margin:8px">This all led up to the release of yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qz9eXA_E7c" target="_blank">Doki Doki Takeover Plus</a>. Which adds, I dunno fucking everything. 2 new weeks, tons of bonus songs a reduxed pixel week and tons of extra polish and charm. After following this mod for so long I am glad to see it reach it's 100% definitive state, a true love letter to Friday Night Funkin' and Doki Doki Literature Club, if you enjoy FNF or DDLC, go play it by clicking <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/47364">HERE</a> now, NOW.</p>
