			<h1>Camera Control and OH MY GOD NEW CORPSE PARTY GAME??? (27/02/2023)</h1>

			<p>Welcome to the second development post about ccmacl's pygame sandbox. I have implemented some new features today, here are the most notable ones:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>CAMERA CONTROL! This is the big one, you can now move around the mortal plane using the arrow keys, allowing for near infinite space for your army, structures etcetra. That is, if you don't go out 2147483647 units in one direction which will crash the game due to a memory overload, but you wouldn't do that would you?</li>
				<li>Explosion sound when deleting objects. This sound, was literally, in the FILES FOR THE GAME YESTERDAY, yet I didn't implement it because, I dunno brain stopped? Regardless, it is in the game and makes it more satisfying to delete things, sound design is everything here to make it satisfying and impactful to do things.</li>
				<li>Object selection, you can now use the number keys to choose between objects to place, but you can only place the "Team 1 Unit" at the moment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thank you for following the development of the game here on the blog. Now today I don't just wanna talk about my game I also wanna talk about the fact that a NEW (potentially) CORPSE PARTY GAME IS IN THE WORKS! I say potentially because it could just be the rest of the chapters for Corpse Party 2: Dead Patient, but I would still take that because I haven't even played Chapter One of Corpse Party 2: Dead Patient yet, so it would be like a new game to me.</p>

			<p>Above you can find an image that was in the article under the "A new Corpse Party game is in the works?" section, it seems to be a teaser for a setting in this new game, which if you take a look at for 5 seconds you'd notice it's a cafe named 'Cafe Teria' from what I can read. Obviously, the place is in a wreck which I presume to be because of the evil spirits of wherever this place is, if it has any, or if this place suffers earthquakes like Heavenly Host, it could also be that. However, there is something, off, about this cafe compared to a normal cafe, it looks a bit too, bland and basic? I suppose? Something that you might see in a hospital perhaps, which may mean this is the cafe that can be found  Amare Patriarcha Crucis, the hospital from Corpse Party 2: Dead Patient. This has me believing this 'new game' is actually just the full version of Dead Patient, I mean, think about it, why would they make Dead Patient Chapter 1 and it's extras, just to completely ditch it? You could argue that the game has been in Development Hell for the last 10 years but they must've made something out of that 10 years. Another arguement could be that the article states that the game only went into production last year, but in defense of my claim I must bring up that the article states that the game has been in pre-production for several years, pre-production being one of the main elements of how a game could enter Development Hell.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in my game and want to pitch any ideas or have any questions about it, or wish to provide me with opinions or questions or whatever on Corpse Party, please fill in <a href="https://forms.gle/iXGRcRAMtCR7TmcQ8"><b>THIS</b></a> form and your questions will be answered and or pitches be reviewed in the next post, or will be discussed if it is Corpse Party related. Thanks for reading once again, and I wish you the best day possible. Goodbye!</p>
