			<h1>Racing Games (28/02/2023)</h1>

			<p>I never really think about my love for racing games that much, mostly due to how different it is to other genres I love: Horror, JRPG, Shooter, Zombies, etcetra. Today I started playing some stuff on my PS2 again, and I consider that console the peak of racing games, stunning simulation games like Gran Turismo 4 that still hold up graphically to this day and quick hop in and play arcade racers like Need for Speed: Underground, with a few having a more semi-open world gameplay loop like Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005).<p>
			<p>These are all games I can play for hours on end, taking part in events and customizing my cars to my hearts content in Gran Turismo 4, taking part in street races in the "Underground" of Olympic City in Need for Speed: Underground, and outmanuvering the cops in the city of Rockport in Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005). Sure these games aren't perfect, starting a new career in Gran Turismo 4 and having to go through the process of getting a license is tedious, the cutscenes in Need for Speed: Underground look really, really bad, and the visuals of Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) reek of early 7th gen console colour schemes.</p>
			<p>Despite these issues, these games are all really fun and I highly recommend you give them a shot or other games in their franchises a shot (except from Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012) of course).</p>
