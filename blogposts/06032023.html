			<p>Sports games are ubiquitous in the videogame market to the detest of hardcore gamers, with annual releases and minimal changes abundant. I personally enjoy sports games a lot but only really buy one sport game per sport. Although, the last few years I can't help but noticed the massive batches of old sports games that nobody wants anymore, and it got me brainstorming a bit recently and I have decided to collect these old sports games for the following reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>They are cheap</li>
				<li>I can use them to get trophies</li>
				<li>It would look really funny to have like 7 FIFA games on my profile</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I plan to get games in franchises like FIFA, PES, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, PGA Tour and Madden. Everytime I get as close to 100% as possible (remember, most if not all of the servers for these games aren't up anymore), I will make a post on the website discussing the game in question and it's differences to previous games in the franchise. If you want a full list of all the games, well, check my home page!</p>
